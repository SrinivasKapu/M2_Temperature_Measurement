# M2_Temperature_Measurement

# Abstract

In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring temperature. This circuit is developed using “Atmega328”, a linear voltage sensor. Temperature is usually measured in “Centigrade” or “Faraheite”.And used the SimuleIDE Software.

# Features
- Low Cost 
- Checks if the driver is seated or not.
- Can modify the temperature according to the passenger.
- Robust System
